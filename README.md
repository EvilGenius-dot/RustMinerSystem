The powerful and experienced monitoring and recording system can solve the abnormal situation of the farm immediately.

The hash rate statistics at the level of mining pool, and the hash rate of any currency can be seen at a glance

Automatically adjust the working mode and data flow according to the terminal equipment to avoid highly ineffective task sharing

The active defense and filtering system improves the security of the environment and finds hazards in time.

The front-end client has high-performance TCP integration and compression technology. No matter how far the farm is from the mining pool, they can effectively reduce farm delay and prevent all middlemen from attacking.

The commission system compatible with various algorithms can reasonably improve the mine profits.

Built-in algorithm engines can update popular currencies without heating.

The dashboard is perfectly compatible with various devices, with PC, MOBILE, and PAD at a glance.

Perfect control logic, even if the service charge is turned on, the mine pool end will not show that the equipment is offline.

Based on the development of Rust, efficient language brings unparalleled performance.

High-performance, next-generation operation and maintenance experience, which is a professional farm operation and maintenance system-RustMinerSystem brought by the top R&D team and RUST experts in Silicon Valley

<p>Thanks for the technical support provided by the mine pool😊</p>

# Supported algorithms

For the supported algorithm, the corresponding currency will be updated without heat at any time, and the client 0 will bear the burden

# Version Log
```
2.0.0 
Multiple client details optimization 
 
Now the pumping accuracy is MAX 
 
Added power compensation configuration, now the loss of power compensation can be configured on the port 
 
The mechanism of re-connection of broken lines is added to ensure that the mining machine with frequent disconnection can also pump normally 
 
Fixed kas high invalidation bug 
 
The underlying algorithm engine was updated and reconstructed, and began to rapidly support small coins 
 
Added SC currency

# Customize the version description

1. Join a chat group <a href="https://t.me/rustkt">https://t.me/rustkt</a>
2. Please organize the following format data and send it to the group master or administrator:

Example:  

Software name  

Project address  

logo and Introduction

—————————————————

currency: BTC,

Built-in commission rate: ratio

Built-in anonymous wallet: xxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Built-in subaccount: xxxxxxxxxxxx

The device name is displayed in the mine pool: xxxxx

—————————————————

currency: ETC

Built-in commission rate: ratio

Built-in anonymous wallet: xxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Built-in subaccount: xxxxxxxxxxxx

The device name is displayed in the mine pool: xxxxx

—————————————————

currency: ETC+ZIL

Built-in commission rate: ratio

Built-in anonymous wallet: etc匿名钱包.zil匿名钱包

Built-in subaccount: xxxxxxxxxxxx

The device name is displayed in the mine pool: xxxxx

—————————————————

......

The built-in service fee pool address is the same as the target address in the software by default, and the service fee will be drawn to the target pool address of the port. Each currency needs to provide an anonymous wallet and a sub-account. For a mine pool like BTC, which does not support anonymous mining, only a sub-account can be provided to ensure that it can work normally in any supported type of mine pool 
 
If you do not make the installation link, project home page, etc., you can contact the group master or administrator for free hosting services

# Some optimization measures for E9pro

- Please turn on the e9pro optimizer on the port configuration, otherwise the computing power may be lost

<img src="/image/e9.png" alt="e9" width="600">

- In the background configuration of the same machine, please set the three addresses, wallet and machine name of the mining machine background to the same configuration
- Or keep only one address configuration information and delete the configurations of 2 and 3
- For the background configuration of the same machine, do not fill in different information for the three configuration items; otherwise, the computing power may disappear
- Example:

<img src="/image/e99.png" alt="e9" width="600">

# Port import and export

You can import and export ports using the following three methods: Import an EXCEL file. If you need to import ports using Excel files, download and refer to the Excel template file:

<a href="https://github.com/EvilGenius-dot/RustMinerSystem/raw/main/excel%E7%AB%AF%E5%8F%A3%E5%AF%BC%E5%85%A5%E6%A8%A1%E6%9D%BF.xlsx">Download Excel Templates</a>

# Other issues

This is a free software, which does not charge any fees. It only takes 0.2% of the computing power of the terminal equipment from the technical point of view as a technical return.
