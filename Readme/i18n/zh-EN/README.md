   [RMS 1.0.0] RMS update.

   Opened RMS connection pool mode.

   [!!! Note: Connection pool mode requires the corresponding connected Rust server version >= 3.8.0]

   (
      To use the RMS public network connection compression feature, please select switch mode in the upper right corner of the RMS client settings,
   and then select connection pool, and set the maximum number of connections.

      The compression rate is calculated as follows:
   
      Compression rate = Number of connected mining machines / Maximum number of connections

      Don't set the compression rate too high. The larger the maximum number of connections, the smaller the hardware load.
      Usually, a compression rate of 3-5 times is sufficient, depending on the hardware of the device where RMS is located and the server.

      The compression here refers to the number of public TCP connections between RMS and the server, not simply merging mining machines.
   )

      The built-in fee pool address defaults to the same address as the target address within the software. The fee will be deducted to the target pool address of the port. For each currency, an anonymous wallet and a sub-account are required. For currencies like BTC that do not support anonymous mining, only a sub-account is required to ensure normal operation on any supported type of mining pool. Cross-pool drainage can also be specified.
